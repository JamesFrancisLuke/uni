# Research Methods

## Module Info

This module (G53IVP) provides an opportunity to put into practice knowledge and understanding that you have developed through the linked module G53FIV. You will gain practical experience of how to design, implement and evaluate a distinctive interactive visualisation which presents information gathered from a complex and interesting data source. The primary focus is on building a working application of information visualization, and so existing strong programming ability is required to take this co-requisite with G53FIV.

## Coursework 1

The final deliverable will be an implementation of the proposed solution (Code repositories) and a 8-15 page paper written in the format of a conference paper submission. Template can be found at this page and it is required to use this template. There is no length restriction, feel free to use as much space as you need for images.

The written report is expected at the end of the project, that include:
Introduction: An explanation of the problem and the motivation for solving it.
Related work: A description of previous papers related to your project.
Methods/Design (storyboard, etc.): A detailed explanation of the techniques and algorithms you used to solve the problem.
Implementation (must include specifics of what other components/libraries you built upon): A detailed explanations on how you implement the visualization.
Results: detailed description of your visualizations
Evaluation (e.g. user study or reflections/discussion of your system): The visualizations your system produces and data to help evaluate your approach. For example you may include running times, or the time users typically spend generating a visualization using your system.
Discussions: What has the audience learned from your work? What new insights or practices has your system enabled? A full blown user study is not expected, but informal observations of use that help evaluate your system are encouraged.
Conclusions and Future Work: A recap of take-aways and detailed description of how your system could be extended or refined.
Bibliography
You will also need to prepare the following for the Demo:

A presentation covers the main visualizations:
Problem: A clear statement of the problem your project addresses.
Motivation: An explanation of why the problem is interesting and what makes it difficult to solve.
Approach: A description of the techniques or algorithms you used to solve the problem.
Results: Screenshots and a working demo of the system you built.
Future Work: An explanation of how the work could be extended.
You should also show live demos of your software in action in the final presentation.
Presentation Format: 10 minutes total. 8 minutes to present + 2 minutes for questions.
